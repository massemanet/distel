Installation
------------

* distel is an extension to erlang-mode, so erlang-mode must be
  present. erlang-node is distributed with OTP, here;
$OTP_PATH/lib/tools-*/emacs/erlang.el

  So you must have something like this in you .emacs;
(add-to-list
   'load-path
       (car (file-expand-wildcards "/usr/lib/erlang/lib/tools-*/emacs")))

* Compile Distel's Erlang modules with 'make'.

* Optionally, install like this;
export prefix=<some fine place> ; make -e install
the elisp file will wind up in $prefix/share/distel/elisp
$prefix defaults to /usr/local, which is cool if you're on e.g. debian.

* Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (again substitute correct path):

  (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/me/jungerl/lib/distel/elisp")
  (require 'distel)
  (distel-setup)

You can also build the documentation in doc/ with 'make postscript'
for a printable manual and 'make install' to install the info manual.

You should now be in the air! If so you should see "Erlang EXT" in the
Emacs modeline when you open an Erlang source file (meaning you're in
the EXTended erlang mode). Check out the manual in doc/ to find out
what you can do!

============================================================
Xemacs compatibility note;
distel seems to work fine in Xemacs.
You will need to install ewoc.el from FSF emacs, e.g. from here;
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/emacs/emacs/lisp/emacs-lisp/ewoc.el

============================================================

Special notes for Mac OSX:
David Wallin reports the following procedure to setup Distel to work
on an OSX machine with no network connection:

1. Start NetInfo Manager.app (in /Applications/Utilities)
2. From NetInfo Manager, select the directory path
   "/machines/localhost" and mark property "name" and (and anytime
   before here: click on the lock and enter the password) choose
   "Append Value" from the "Directory" menu.
3. Enter your machine name as the appended value and Save.

This procedure is like putting "127.0.0.1 <hostname>" into /etc/hosts
on a UNIX machine. It's necessary so that Emacs can open sockets to
the localhost via the hostname part of a nodename without talking to
DNS.

Special notes for Gentoo Users:
on Gentoo ,documents about erlang is not installed under code:root_dir()
but some path like /usr/share/doc/erlang-15.2/html/
so if you using `C-cC-dh' and 'C-cC-dz', you need change 'otp_doc.erl' like this:

init(Props) ->
  Dir = "/usr/share/doc/erlang-15.2/html",
  %% Dir =  proplists:get_value(root_dir, Props, code:root_dir()),

  Prot = proplists:get_value(prot, Props, file),
  ets:new(?MODULE,[named_table,ordered_set]),
  try html_index(Prot,Dir),
      {ok,#state{root_dir=Dir,prot=Prot}}
  catch _:_ ->
      {ok,no_html}
  end.
