;;; erlookup.el

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module contains a naive, inefficient and buggy way to lookup
;; macro and record definitions. Sort of like M-. for functions.
;;
;; NOTE: This is a work in progress and stuff change all the time. There
;; are also a couple of known bugs. Since it makes use of simple and
;; dumb regexps for finding stuff it's easy finding definitions like
;; '-define(foo, bar)' but a bit trickier finding other cases with lists
;; of definitions, etc.

;; NOTE: We now try to ask a running distel node what include paths were
;; used when compiling the current module. For this to work you will
;; need to compile the module with +debug_info.

;; The original `erlookup-roots' variable can still be set, but it is
;; not needed if you have a distel node running. If it is set the paths
;; will still be used.

;; If you have `erlookup-roots' set you will also not need a running
;; node for the lookup to work.

;; `erlookup-roots' are set like this:

;; (setq erlookup-roots '("~/projects/foo/lib"
;;                        "~/path/to/otp/headers"))

;; This is all a bit hackish for now, but it seems to work. Distel will
;; however complain about the node being down if you do lookups
;; "offline".

;; NOTE: This offline lookup functionality might be ripped out to a
;; separate elisp package altogether sooner or later. It would be a
;; better fit in a new erlang-mode utilizing the a cedet parser for
;; Erlang.

;; TODO: 'inline' lookups of macros to e.g. jump to record definitions
;; when standing on '#?name_of_record', and jump to function definitions
;; when standing on '?name_of_function(Foo, Bar)'.

;; TODO: Make everything less side-effecty.
